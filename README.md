# Url-Shortener
The URL Shortener is a web application that generates shorter URLs for long links. It consists of a client-side component (HTML, CSS, JS) and a server-side component (Node.js, Express, MongoDB).

The client-side allows users to enter long URLs, sends requests to the server, and displays the generated short URLs. It dynamically updates an HTML table to show the stored long URLs and their corresponding short URLs.

The server-side handles URL shortening, retrieval, and redirection. It utilizes Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Existing URLs are fetched from the database, and new ones are stored in the database url-shortener.urls
